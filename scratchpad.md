I have a project for you. You can find the details in a file called "tmp/stoploss_project.md". Once you read that file, please ask me any clarifying questions you may have. I will be happy to answer them. Once you are ready to start, please create a project directory at "tmp/stoploss_project" and start working on it. All of you work should go in that directory. When you are done, please let me know and I can review your work. I'm also available to answer any questions you might have as you work. Good luck!
